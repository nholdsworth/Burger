# Eat Da Burger??
Full stack application for pointlessly moving things from one side of the screen to the other.  This app utilizes mySQL database, Node.js, Express.js and Bootstrap as well as handlebars for templating

## Description

This application demonstrates a simple full stack application with a front end using HTML and CSS created with handlebars and bootstrap.  The backend is created using Node.js and Express.js

If this app was working, a user could use the create a burger form to update the database with a new burger name that would then be displayed under the burgers that you have not yet enjoyed heading.  The user can then track all the burgers they have eaten (super useful) by clicking on the eat it button.  Once the eat it button is clicked, the name of the burger will move to the section of the website beneath the heading of the burgers that you have already enjoyed.
